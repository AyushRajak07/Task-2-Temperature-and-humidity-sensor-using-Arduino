# Arduino-Based Temperature and Humidity Sensor Using DHT22  

This project demonstrates how to measure temperature and humidity using the DHT22 sensor and an Arduino. It provides real-time data readings that can be displayed on a serial monitor or integrated with other components like an LCD or IoT platforms for further applications.  

## Features  
- **Accurate Measurements:** Uses the DHT22 sensor for precise temperature and humidity readings.  
- **Real-Time Data:** Continuously collects and displays environmental data.  
- **Easy Integration:** Suitable for IoT and home automation systems.  
- **Customizable Code:** Modify the Arduino sketch to fit your specific use case.  

## Components  
- Arduino (e.g., Uno, Mega, or similar)  
- DHT22 Sensor  
- Connecting wires  
- Optional: Breadboard, LCD display  

## How It Works  
1. The DHT22 sensor reads temperature and humidity data from the environment.  
2. The Arduino processes the data and sends it to the serial monitor or an output device.  
3. The project can be expanded to log data or send it to a cloud platform for remote monitoring.  

## Setup Instructions  
1. Connect the DHT22 sensor to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.  
2. Upload the provided code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the live data readings.  

## Applications  
- Weather monitoring  
- Smart homes and IoT systems  
- Environmental research projects
